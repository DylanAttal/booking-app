# Summary

This is the first app I built with Go!

I followed along with [TechWorld with Nana's Golang Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyUHQIec83I&t=7633s).

I built a small CLI application that books tickets for users who are attending a Go conference.

The app asks for basic user information including name, email, and number of tickets they would like to book.
